<ol>
<li><b>Know your audience.</b> Having a good sense of your audience ensures you're picking the right vocabulary, colors, information, hyperlinks, photos, etc. that will draw attention to your content.</li>   <br>
<li><b>Keep it concise, simple, and straightforward.</b> This will keep your audience engaged, makes your text skimmable, and eliminate confusion.</li><br>
<li><b>Use the inverted pyramid.</b> Provide the basic info readers need upfront in case they don't stick around long. You can get into the details later.</li><br>
<li><b>Chunk your content.</b> Briefer paragraphs and even single sentences are easy to read and scan. Breaking up content into subsections, lists, etc. also helps create hierarchy on your site.</li>  <br>
<li><b>Talk to your reader.</b> Don't be afraid to use pronouns and talk directly to the reader. This keeps it casual and personal and is more engaging.</li> <br>
<li><b>Use active voice.</b> It's more direct, it improves the pacing of your writing, and it's engaging too!</li> <br>
<li><b>Show, don't tell.</b> If you tell someone something without showing, it affects your credibility. Explain why. Give readers the details they need (and want). And include relevant hyperlinks, too.</li><br>
